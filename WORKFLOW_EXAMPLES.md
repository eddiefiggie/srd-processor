# Smart Workflow Resume Examples

## Example 1: First Run (No Files)
```
🔍 Checking existing files...
📋 Current Workflow Status:
   ❌ Raw text extraction (srd_raw_text.txt)
   ❌ Basic cleanup (srd_cleaned_output.md)
   ❌ AI cleanup (srd_ai_cleaned.md)
   ❌ RAG chunking (export/ directory)

📋 No existing files found - will start from PDF extraction.
```

## Example 2: Partial Progress (Raw Text Exists)
```
🔍 Checking existing files...
📋 Current Workflow Status:
   ✅ Raw text extraction (srd_raw_text.txt)
   ❌ Basic cleanup (srd_cleaned_output.md)
   ❌ AI cleanup (srd_ai_cleaned.md)
   ❌ RAG chunking (export/ directory)

📑 Raw text exists but no cleaned files found.
Would you like to:
  1. Start fresh (re-extract PDF)
  2. Resume from basic cleanup step

## Example 3: Most Work Done (Ready for Chunking)

   ❌ RAG chunking (export/ directory)

## Benefits of Smart Resume

1. **Time Saving**: Never re-extract PDF or re-process files unnecessarily
2. **Cost Saving**: Avoid re-running expensive AI cleanup if already done
3. **Flexibility**: Jump to any step you want (e.g., just chunking)
4. **Safe**: Always asks before overwriting existing work
5. **Clear Status**: Shows exactly what's been done and what's missing
